<h3>HTML and CSS Week</h3>
<p>
    I am excited about this course. This being the first week refreshed my memory on HTML and CSS.
    I installed Visual Studio along with setting up my site on CCIS server.
    I read about HTML and did experiments on basic tags, form, audio, video and embedding HTML.
    I also read CSS and did experiments on grid which was taught to us in class, created an animated menu
    and displayed different images based on screen sizes.
    The toughest experiment for me was to animate transition of detailed menu when there was a
    mouse hover event. This experiment cleared my fundamentals of how to create an animated menu.
    Creating a responsive design for different screen sizes was helpful as it would help me to understand
    the working of bootstrap.
    Excited to learn bootstrap next week.
