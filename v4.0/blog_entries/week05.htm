<h3>Angular JS Routing Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I learned about routing in Angular JS. It follows MVC pattern in which a controller is 
    used to handle model and view and $scope provides a binding between them. Angular JS Routing is used 
    for changing contents of the page without reloading the page. The hardest part to learn was to upload 
    file and convert into JSON format. Found out Angular doesn't have native libraries to support it. 
    Tried since evening and got success in uploading image at 4:10 AM :)
