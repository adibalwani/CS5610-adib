<h3>MongoDB Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I learned about MongoDB, and its several queries for its database. Also, I installed 
    MongoDB on my openshift to host database. Came across ui-bootstrap angularJS module and used it for 
    modal. Still having trouble to display image using its controller. Implemented few pieces of my project 
    as part of my experiments. Finding APIs for my project.
