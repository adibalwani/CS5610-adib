<h3>Node JS Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I started with Node Js on local host. Next, I created my account on openShift, setup my 
    website. To do so three steps are needed:
</p>
<p>
    1) Install Ruby, Git to the system
</p>
<p>
    2) Install npm and setup the server and clone on local repository
</p>
<p>
    3) Using npm install node_modules that are neccessar for the project
</p>
<p>
    In all learned a very popular back end service. Excited to learn MongoDB
