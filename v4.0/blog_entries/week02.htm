<h3>JavaScript/jQuery and Bootstrap Week</h3>
<p>
    This week was hectic as I had to learn JavaScript/jQuery. Took two days to learn both of them.
    Next I learned about Google Maps API as it would be used in my project. The alarm experiments
    is important for learning setInterval()/setTimeout() functions. setInterval shouldnot be used if there are
    multiple calls to the setInterval. I also learned about bootstrap on Friday's lecture and 
    changed all my previous experiments of this week to incorporate boostrap and hence get an
    experience using it. Lastly, I will be performing a final experiment tomorrow and getting 
    my project idea approved by professor.
