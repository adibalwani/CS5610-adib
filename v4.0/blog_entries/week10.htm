<h3>Project Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I explored detailed features and used those of the Carma API. The functionalities 
    of my project site is almost ready just a few validations left. Will work on the UI starting 
    next week. Also, I needed to create back-end for favorites and review feature as API required 
    a trip to be taken in order for a user to review others.
