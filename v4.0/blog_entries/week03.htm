<h3>JSON/jQuery UI Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I learned about JSON and jQueryUI. Performed basic experiments this week. 
    As I performed jQuery/Javascript experiments previous week, there was not much to do this week. 
    Learned Sortable, Draggable, local storage, etc. 
    Looking forward to learn SPA, MEAN stack next week.
