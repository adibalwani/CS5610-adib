<h3>Angular JS Week</h3>
<p>
    In this week I learned about Angular JS. Angular JS features two way binding between HTML and JS. 
    It follows MVC pattern in which change to model is reflected immediately on the view and vice-versa. 
    Angular Js follows server side technologies, so it has $scope, $index, $http, etc. objects 
    declared which is used for binding between controller and model. This binding is two way.
