        <p>
            This is the end of Web Development Course. <br />

            During the course I learned many cutting edge technologies like jQuery, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB and most importantly AngularJS. <br />

            A big thanks to Prof. Jose Annunziato for teaching me these technolgies and increasing my skill set to a great extent. <br />

            I would also like to thank my TA Rishi Katyal for reviewing my work weekly. <br />

            Beside this, other resources used in learning were Google, Maps API, StackOverflow, W3 Schools, Carma API. <br />

            I am happy to put a good looking website and hope everybody likes it. <br />

            Thank you <a href="https://api-dev.car.ma/apidoc/" target="_blank">Carma</a> for providing me the database and API support.
