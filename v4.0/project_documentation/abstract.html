            Carpooling makes ridesharing easy, safe, and accesible to all. It connects drivers who already
            have a journey planned, with people who need a ride in the same direction. In just a few seconds,
            you can offer empty seats in your car, and passengers can book to ride along. By using the Carma app,
            carpoolers have access to fast and convenient mobility - and can share traveling costs.

            At CARNET I want to move the world. Nothing beats the street as infrastructure for individual
            mobility. But with millions of cars on the road, this asset needs to be better utilized. The
            carpooling system is designed to do just that, by making ridesharing easy, safe, and convenient for
            both drivers and passengers.
