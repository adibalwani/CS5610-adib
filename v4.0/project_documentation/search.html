        <h1>Search Feature</h1>
        <p>
            This retrieves a list of trips according to the parameters that were supplied.

            When a driver has set up a trip and is ready to carpool, and riders have similar travel requirements, the discovery API endpoints can be used to discover these matches.

            The primary way to achieve this is through the /trip/tripMatches endpoint.

            It is also possible to search for trips that match an origin and destination through trip/searchTrips.

            Both of these search endpoints contain many filtering options including whether you want to find drivers, riders or both.

            The driver can also use the Carma Crew endpoint to see other people they may want to take a trip with which includes nearby users, favourite users, and users the driver has booked with or messaged previously.
